    ### Key Findings
    
    **Current Situation:** Singapore, Indonesia, and Malaysia face a medium risk of experiencing a severe transboundary haze event for the rest of 2025, according to an assessment released Monday by the Singapore Institute of International Affairs. This marks an increase from 2024's "low" risk rating.
    
    **Primary Causes:** Haze from biomass burning due to forest fires and peat burning is of major concern because of its adverse impact on regional air quality in Southeast Asia. The main driver is the annual burning of forests and peatlands in Indonesia, primarily for agricultural purposes such as palm oil and pulpwood plantations.
    
    **Health Impact:** Findings from scanning electron microscope data showed that 94% of the particles in the haze were below 2.5 Œºm in diameter and therefore can easily bypass the normal body defence metabolism and penetrate deeply into the alveoli of the lungs.
    
    **Economic Impact:** Almost all economic sectors also experienced losses, with the heaviest losses in the agriculture and tourism sectors.
    
    **Government Response:** The Malaysian government is setting the stage for transformative changes that position the nation as a potential leader in the sustainability space with over RM300 million allocated under the National Energy Transition Roadmap.

    ### Historical Haze Episodes
    
    **Major Episodes:**
    - **1997:** Arguably the most severe haze episode in Malaysian history, causing widespread disruption and severe health impacts
    - **2005:** Another significant haze event, leading to school closures and a decline in air quality across much of the country
    - **2013:** This episode saw some of the highest Air Pollutant Index (API) readings ever recorded in Malaysia, prompting a state of emergency in several regions
    - **2015:** A prolonged haze event that blanketed much of Southeast Asia, causing significant economic losses and health concerns. That year, forest and peatland fires in Indonesia sent thick plumes rolling across the region, pushing the Air Pollutant Index (API) in places like Shah Alam past a hazardous 300
    - **2019:** A more recent episode that highlighted the continued challenges in combating haze despite ongoing efforts
    
    ### Current Risk Assessment
    
    The latest report marks an increase from the institute's 2024 assessment, which rated the risk as "low" on its three-tier scale of low, medium, and high. Elevated agricultural prices and a rise in deforestation have heightened the likelihood of fires and haze.

    ### Economic Impact Analysis
    
    **Agriculture Sector:** For farmers, especially those who depend on sunlight-sensitive crops like rice, fruit and vegetables, even a week of heavy haze can mean smaller harvests. Prolonged exposure to polluted air can damage plant tissues, reduce photosynthesis and disrupt natural habitats.
    
    **Tourism Industry:** Tourism dips during haze periods as outdoor activities become unsafe and visibility is severely reduced.
    
    **Healthcare System:** Exposure to haze can cause respiratory problems, eye irritation, and other health issues, particularly for vulnerable groups like children and the elderly.
    
    **Business Operations:** Construction slows, tourism dips, and rising medical leave reduces productivity during haze episodes.
    
    ### Social Impacts
    
    **Education Disruption:** Schools were shut, outdoor events scrapped, and clinics filled with people coughing and wheezing during severe haze episodes.
    
    **Public Health:** Haze events have been shown to cause health issues and mortality in affected areas.
    
    **Quality of Life:** Livelihoods are disrupted, properties are damaged and lives are endangered.

    st.markdown("""
    ### Primary Causes
    
    **Agricultural Land Clearing:** Industrial-scale slash-and-burn practices to clear land for agricultural purposes are a major cause of the haze, particularly for palm oil and pulpwood production in the region. Burning land occurs as it is cheaper and faster compared to cutting and clearing using excavators or other machinery.
    
    **Peatland Fires:** Most haze events have resulted from smoke from fires that occurred on peatlands in Sumatra and the Kalimantan region of Borneo island.
    
    **Climate Factors:** El Ni√±o - Southern Oscillation (ENSO) influences the intensity of haze episodes. Haze events, where air quality reaches hazardous levels due to high concentrations of airborne particulate matter from burning biomass, have caused adverse health, environmental and economic impacts in several countries in Southeast Asia.
    
    **Local Factors:** The answer often lies within, particularly in areas vulnerable to bushfires and peat soil fires. Sarawak, with its unique geographical diversity, cultural practices, and agricultural methods, presents a complex landscape for fire prevention.
    
    ### Contributing Factors
    
    **Economic Incentives:** The practice continues because burning land occurs as it is cheaper and faster compared to cutting and clearing using excavators or other machinery.
    
    **Governance Challenges:** Poor accountability and transparency of Indonesian agricultural companies, and limited political and economic incentives to hold companies to account, have been identified as key barriers to mitigating the issue.
    
    **Climate Change:** Haze itself worsens climate change. And beyond murky views of the skyline, there are real costs.

    ### Funding Details
    
    **ADB Climate Finance:** ADB aims to deliver over $100 billion in cumulative climate finance from its own resources between 2019 and 2030. As of 2024, ADB has already committed $41.9 billion toward this goal.
    
    **Regional Financing Gap:** Meeting climate mitigation and adaptation needs in emerging and developing Asia requires investment of at least $1.1 trillion annually. Actual investment falls short by about $800 billion.
    
    **Southeast Asia Specific:** Southeast Asia needs an estimated $3.1 trillion, or $210 billion annually, from 2016 to 2030 to support climate-compatible infrastructure, renewable energy, energy efficiency, food security, agriculture, and land use.
    
    ### NGO Funding Sources
    
    **French Embassy Program:** Requested allocations shall not exceed 6 700 ‚Ç¨ i.e., approximately 33 600 MYR (depending on exchange rate) for Malaysian NGOs working on marine and coastal ecosystem preservation.
    
    **Local Funding Challenges:** Most environmental NGOs in Malaysia rely on limited grants, volunteer contributions, and international donor support for their operations.

    ### Key Achievements
    
    **Greenpeace Malaysia:** Greenpeace takes peaceful action to confront decision-makers and hold them accountable to people and the planet. The organization focuses on investigations and documentation of evidence to pinpoint who could be the source of major forest fires and deforestation in the region.
    
    **Sahabat Alam Malaysia:** Friends of Earth Malaysia is an independent non-profit organisation focusing on environmental issues that impact communities across Malaysia, working towards environmental justice.
    
    **Youth Movement:** The group, formed in March, has seized the momentum of the global climate protests to push for political commitments and climate education at home.
    
    ### Regional Activism Trends
    
    **Indigenous Rights Integration:** A key aim of the group was to join forces with the nation's indigenous groups, who are already battling big business for their forest lands. It's a "massive oversight" to leave them out of the climate movement.
    
    **Youth Leadership:** Despite the risks of protesting in parts of the region, young people are leading the call for their governments to act urgently and stop environmental catastrophe.
    
    **Justice Framing:** The framing by younger activists of climate change as a global justice issue was proving more effective than an environmental message alone.

    ### Background
    Last year, more than 35,000 tons of it was shipped to Malaysia, which received more discarded plastic from rich nations than any other developing country. But in June, Malaysian leaders effectively banned future shipments.
    
    ### Community Response
    **Grassroots Activism:** Pua Lay Peng is a local activist leading a grassroots environmental group called Persatuan Tindakan Alam Sekitar Kuala Langat (Kuala Langat Environmental Action Group) in Malaysia. The group was active in campaigning against the imported plastic waste problem that was affecting their small town, Jenjarom.
    
    **Local Impact:** With over 40 illegal plastic factories emitting toxic gases into the air and polluting the local rivers and waterways, they were making people very sick.
    
    ### Government Action
    **Policy Response:** But last month, Malaysian leaders effectively banned future shipments of plastic waste from developed countries.
    
    **Global Context:** Malaysia is joining a whole host of other countries that really started with China a few years ago, standing up to the United States and other countries and saying no more.

    ### Forest Loss Statistics
    
    **National Overview:** Of all tree cover loss between 2001 to 2023 in Malaysia was in Sarawak (3.27Mha) and Sabah (1.88Mha), followed by Pahang (1.27Mha).
    
    **Recent Developments:** Just a fortnight ago, Malaysia ‚Äî including parts of Sarawak ‚Äî was shrouded in an unexpected spell of unhealthy haze.
    
    ### Climate Change Connection
    
    **Carbon Impact:** Fires from biomass burning potentially contribute to global warming and climate change due to the emission of large amounts of greenhouse gases and other pyrogenic products.
    
    **Forest Role:** Malaysia boasts a total forested area of 18.27 million hectares, with 10.92 million hectares designated as Permanent Reserve Forests and 3.31 million hectares as fully protected areas. These forests play a crucial role by sequestering approximately three-quarters of the country's total carbon dioxide emissions.
    
    **Deforestation Impact:** Deforestation is responsible for 20% of the total global GHG emissions, and a significant part of our ecosystem and species loss.
    
    ### NGO Response to Recent Fires
    
    **Greenpeace Action:** Our work is to hold polluters, governments and groups responsible for devastating environmental acts, accountable. And it all starts with investigations and documentation of evidence to pinpoint who could be the source of major forest fires and deforestation in the region.
    
    **Community Engagement:** Alongside evidence gathered, we conduct research while working with allies and indigenous communities to call out for sustainable solutions in the protection of forests.
    
    **Current Status:** Despite the best of intentions, fire prevention strategies are not always effectively implemented, largely due to resource constraints, difficult terrain and the evolving challenges brought about by climate change.
